|Very important: A 5min video of new functionality, showing a significant delta from old. | 3 | The demo demonstrating the new functionality can be found within the [README.md](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/blob/master/README.md) | 
| Bonus: Xfold improvement | 3 | For a full list of our improvements, view all of the features we develped in the [DELTA_FUNCTIONALITY.md](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/blob/master/docs/functionality_delta.md). Paired with the video, this provides comprehensize coverage of what we updated.  For additional ways to view our project progress, visit our project board which tracked our 'enhancement' issues with a blue tag. For scalability, we were able to scale our application an x10000 amount by adding in pagination. We now are able to pass limited values of our applications to the front end to ensure that there isn't a data overload. | 
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 3 | Website documentation has many different linking html pages including descriptions of each individual function/class. This can be found by opening /doc/index.html within a browser and viewing the online documentation.  |

|Other automated analysis tools| 3 | Used CodeQl to find security issues and enabled other github security workflows. |
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others, but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 3 | From [GH Insights](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/graphs/contributors), team members on average are each responsible for 20 commits.

|Issues are being closed| 3 | At the time of submission, all issues have sparked discussions with teammates and have been closed. |
|DOI badge: exists| 3 | From GH within [README.md](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/blob/master/README.md). It also is found within the citation document and about us section of repo.|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 3 | Documentation is generated. All .md files within repo are neatly organized, link to other areas and support users ease of use. Website documentation has css file included to ensure it looks nice and is easily navigable. |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 3 | Mini tutorials included in the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/blob/master/INSTALL.md) guide under User Workflows. In addition, our 5 minute video contains a demo showcasing the delta of functionality and our address to scalability.|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 3 | [README.md](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/blob/master/README.md) is engaging and includes eye catching images, phrases about how users can benefit from the software, and an overview of of setup/running the software. The linked video is clear and attracts users. |  
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 3 | Great animated video on [README.md](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J) that shows why people should use the tool and launches into a brief demo. This was built using an animation software and provided by Project 1 team. | 
|Use of version control tools| 3 | Git utilized. Over 16 branches utilized and some commits reverted to. Proper version control practices were upheld.| 
|Test cases exist| 3 | Test Cases exist ([Evidence](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/tree/master/__tests__)) and are ran as a part of commit workflow ([Evidence](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/actions/workflows/backend_test.yml)) |
|Test cases are routinely executed| 3 | Executed as part of Commit Pipeline ([Evidence](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/actions)|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3 |  [Contribution]([CONTRIBUTION.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)) information is up to date. Links are included within the file to point to additional resources or areas on the git page that should be used when contributing. |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed| 3 | Issues include comments about the status of the issue before being closed. One such example of a discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/issues/3](https://github.com/nakraft/tracker4J/issues/5) Issues were also discussed in discord or during trouble shooting meetings prior to closing the isse. |
|Chat channel: exists| 3 | Chat channel is available and is activly used. It was started on August 25, 2022. While no 'statistic' insights are available within discord, the chat channel averages 15-35 messages a day regarding deliverables, scheduling meetings, code debugging and feature ideation. A small screen shot of a sample of text has been extracted as evidence: ![discord evidence](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/blob/main/docs/documentation_photos/discord_evidence.jpg) For more details about the discord conversation, you can join the channel [here](https://discord.gg/PDnJtzCW) |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.| 2 | Test cases made up 7 issues throughout the development. This should have been a much higher number to address the bugs identified throughout development. It should be noted though, that the provide against regressions, our team fixed all code before committing back to development, so this number is lower than the actual amount of bugs identified.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 | All members contributing across branches. Development/testing has occured on multiple machines. Package.json, Package-lock.json, and requirements.txt provide a listing of the dependencies needed so that each participant can instantiate a directory with the same parameters.  |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3 | Config file was updated frequently by different members. Specifically, over TODO commits to the config files have been made by 5 people.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3 | The entire team has access to the repository and is able to run the demo. We ensured this by having different members screen share and run the program during troubleshooting sessions.  | 
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3 | Most participants working across areas with a primary focus on one area. - Natalie supported statistics and job card tracking, but worked to implement support debugging of reminder popups and pagination functionality and provided documentation - Ashrita worked on reminder popups, uploading resumes and documentation - Parth worked on workflows, testing and secure authentication - Siddarth supported overall debugging as well as pagination and containerization of the app - Kanishk worked on upload resume functionality - Sumer worked on pagination and frontend functionality as well as provided lots of debugging suport.  |
|Short release cycles | 3 |  Evident from multiple commits. Over 120+ commits total in 16+ different branches. |
