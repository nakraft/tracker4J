## Goal

Your personalized JobTracker application in one place!

## Description

Excel sheets that are complex and disorganized must go! Every job-related data can be managed by our JobTrackr Application, including your job profile, applications, status, important dates, notes, saved applications, job descriptions, recruiter details, compensation and offer package, and more.

## NEW User Workflows (what a significant improvement from v1!)

Our __NEW functionalities__ include: 

- Adding/updating applications with contact information, interview dates, or job requests. 
- Storing your resume for jobs so that you can customize each one
- Tracking career fairs and ensuring you can make it to one on time.
- Querying applications to ensure you can find what you are looking for
- Statistics regarding your job search

Plus we care about security and have integrated in Base64 authentication between our server and client! 

Lastly, we want to make sure you can apply to jobs to your hearts content, to __scale__ up the project, we have paginated the applications tab so that you won't be limited by how many applications you can navigate through. 

For more details regarding User Workflows, visit our user workflows which are included in the [install guide](INSTALL.md)
